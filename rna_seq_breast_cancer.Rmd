## Download data 
Data is downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/. There are 3 rna-seq files from tumor tissue samples and 3 file from normal tissue samples that are fastq files.

The output files are:

![](/Users/nnthieu/rnaseq/p1.jpg){width=60% height=250px}

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
system("wget \
-O "/Users/nnthieu/genome_ref/gtf/hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz" \
"https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/genes/hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz" ")

system("gzip -d /Users/nnthieu/genome_ref/gtf/hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz ")

```

## Indexing reference files using STAR.

It takes so long time to run this STAR funtionc.For indexing the human genome, STAR may require more than 32GB of RAM and it may take a long time depending on the computer RAM and the number of processors used.

```{r  eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
